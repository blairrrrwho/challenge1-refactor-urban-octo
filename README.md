# Code Refactor for Horiseon Webpage

## The Main Goal
This repository is to refactor the existing code for Horiseon in order to make the webpage more accessible to those who visit it. The first objective is to edit the codebase so that it meets the accessibility standards need to optimize the page for seearch engines. We will use semantic HTML elements and logically structure them accordingly, check functionality of existing links, reorder and clean up the codebase where necessary, and include comments to describe those changes. We want to keep the external behavior of the website the same, only making internal changes to the code.
