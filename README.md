# Code Refactor for Horiseon Webpage

## The Main Goal
The big idea here is to refactor the existing code for the Horiseon webpage in order to make the site more accessible. The first objective is to edit the codebase so that it meets the accessibility standards needed to optimize the page for seearch engines. 
The second objective is to use semantic HTML elements to logically realign the flow of the codebase for better structure, while also rearranging the CSS stylesheet for better consodlidation, efficiency, and to ensure it follows the semantic structure of the HTML elements. 
Lastly, we will check for the main functionality of any links, images, accessbility attributes, and clean up where necessary.
Since the goal is to keep the website's behavior the same, I've included comments throughout both pages of code to explain the necessary changes.

## Usage
The new codebase has been consolidated and reformatted to fit a logical structure. For future changes, the user will not have to make as many tedioius changes in the CSS stylsheet as before, and the elements and properies are much easier to locate. Looking at the HTML page and the CSS stylesheet side by side, the user will be able to notice that the CSS layout follows the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and can easily edit both at the same time. 
The user's website will now be optimized for search engines because of the accessibility standards the site now meets. 
Those who use assistive technologies to interpret text and images on a webpage will now have the accessibility to do so on the Horiseon webpage. 
Both the editor of the webpage and those who view it will now have a better experience, as the objective overall was to improve the codebase's functionality and layout for now and the future - to simplify the editing process, and improve the user experience.
